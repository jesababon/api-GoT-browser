# Game of Thrones Character Browser Lab

You've had some practice with the Game of Thrones API, now it's time to put that data in the DOM! 

Your goal is to read data from the Game of Thrones character API and create a webpage that displays that data.

## Step One

Create an HTML page that embeds a separate JavaScript file.

Make an AJAX request to the first page of [the character list in the Game of Thrones API](https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters?page=1&pageSize=50), and render each separate character in a list.

## Step Two

Add a "Next" and "Previous" Button, which will move to the next "page" of character results from the API.
